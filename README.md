# WaxOn (CLI)
**Consistent, safe, and DAW-ready audio** ‚Äî a fast, no-nonsense preprocessing step for podcast dialogue and VO.

WaxOn converts mixed-quality recordings into clean, **24-bit mono WAV** files at a fixed **working loudness** of **‚àí25 LUFS**, applies a **brick-wall limiter** (no makeup gain), and performs essential safety cleanup (DC blocking, optional declip repair, true-peak oversampling, proper dithering).  
The result is predictable, unclipped, and ready to drop into your DAW timeline.

> **Why ‚àí25 LUFS?**  
> It‚Äôs a *working* loudness target for editing ‚Äî not a mastering level.  
> At this stage you want headroom, not maximum volume.  
> ‚àí25 LUFS provides a consistent baseline that keeps different voices comparable while leaving space for EQ boosts, compression, and mastering downstream.  
> Loudness normalization follows the EBU R128 algorithm (integrated LUFS, gated), so silences and natural pauses are factored into the final level ‚Äî giving you a realistic ‚Äúreal-world‚Äù loudness reading.

## Features

- **24-bit PCM WAV, mono (left channel)** at **44.1 kHz** or **48 kHz**
- **Two-pass normalization** to **‚àí25 LUFS** when possible (single-pass fallback)
- **Brick-wall limiter** (no makeup gain) with configurable ceiling
- **DC blocker** (gentle 20 Hz high-pass to remove offsets)
- **Optional declip** repair (auto/on/off) before gain adjustment
- **True-peak oversampling** (4√ó / 8√ó) + **TPDF high-pass dither**
- **Atomic writes:** hidden temp file until complete (no half-written renders)
- **Detailed logging** at `~/Library/Logs/waxon_v*.log`

## Installation

WaxOn requires **macOS** and **FFmpeg** (installed automatically if missing).  
Two install options are available:

### üß© Minimal user install
Downloads the latest `waxon.sh` and installs it globally.

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sevmorris/WaxOn/main/install.sh)"
```

After installation, you can run WaxOn from anywhere:
```bash
waxon input.wav
```

---

### üßë‚Äçüíª Developer install (clone + symlink)
For contributors or power users who want the local repo for quick updates.

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sevmorris/WaxOn/main/install.sh)" -- --dev
```

This clones the repo to:
```
~/.local/share/waxon/
```

‚Ä¶and creates a symlink in `/usr/local/bin` or `/opt/homebrew/bin`.  
To update later:
```bash
cd ~/.local/share/waxon && git pull
```

---

## Usage

```bash
waxon [file1] [file2] ...
```

Each file is converted and leveled individually.  
You‚Äôll be prompted to select a sample rate (44.1 kHz / 48 kHz) and limiter ceiling (‚àí1 dBFS ‚Ä¶ ‚àí6 dBFS).  

Output files are written next to the originals:

```
example.wav     ‚Üí example-44kwaxon--1dB.wav
```

---

## Uninstall

To completely remove WaxOn, use the included `uninstall.sh` script.  
It detects whether you installed via **Minimal** or **Developer** mode and removes the correct files.

### üßπ Minimal uninstall
```bash
sudo rm -f "$(which waxon)"
rm -f ~/Library/Logs/waxon_*.log
```

### üß© Developer uninstall
```bash
sudo rm -f "$(which waxon)"
rm -rf ~/.local/share/waxon
```

Or use the included uninstaller for full automatic cleanup:
```bash
./uninstall.sh --yes --purge
```

Options:
- `--yes` ‚Äì non-interactive (no confirmation prompts)
- `--purge` ‚Äì also deletes logs in `~/Library/Logs/`
- `--dry-run` ‚Äì show what would be deleted without removing anything
- `--verbose` ‚Äì show additional diagnostic output

---

## Logs

All sessions write a detailed log file under:
```
~/Library/Logs/waxon_v1.x.log
```
These logs include ffmpeg filters used, LUFS readings, limiter activity, and any error messages.

---

## Requirements

- **macOS 10.15 or later**
- **FFmpeg 8.0 +**
- **Homebrew** (installed automatically if missing)

---

## Versioning

Current: **WaxOn v1.x ‚Äî initial CLI release**

Future versions may add:
- Batch-mode options (non-interactive)
- Preset profiles for specific workflows
- Cross-platform Linux support
